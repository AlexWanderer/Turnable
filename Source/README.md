Turnable
========

A Unity-compatible Framework written in C# that can be used to create any kind of Turn Based game. 

What makes Turnable different from others of its kind? Well, once fleshed out, the Framework will support the following features:

* Plug and Play Artificial Intelligence (AI)
    * Monte Carlo Simulations based AI 
    * Goal based AI
    * State Machines
    * IQ based AI difficulty
* Pathfinding
* Line of Sight (LoS)
* Tiled (TMX) support
* Skills, Stats, Inventories etc.

I'm currently rewriting the old version of this Framework (check out the archive branch for a preview) from scratch.
